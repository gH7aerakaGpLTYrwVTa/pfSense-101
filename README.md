## Introduction

This repo is for information about Pfsense, Netgate, Unifi, and other basics that a user may need to setup a secure home network. It geared towards users with an average skill level, and I will also assume that most want Wifi capability.

Some helpful scripts will be included in the repo if you wish to use them. There are a lot of videos in this guide, and if you do not like learning via video then you might want to look elsewhere. I think the average user will really enjoy how powerful this setup can be!

**TODO:** make unifi network controller setup script

## Let's Get Started

**1.** Get familiar with the Netgate SG-1100 using these videos below or other resources you prefer. I have included video dates to make users aware that some features that appear may have updated, changed, or look different in some way. Keep in mind the age of any video and do your own research!

- [The Netgate pfsense SG-1100 Still A Good Home Router? What About Gaming?](https://youtu.be/6VqeB5eXjq0) - Sep 13, 2019

**2.** You can also do a [DIY Pfsense build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kSZ1oM-4ZM) if you have the proper hardware on hand and feel comfortable doing so. Also, take a look at the [Netgate SG-3100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbSUdDyfW0M) if you need something a little bit more powerful. There are plenty of options for average users, small biz, and more.

**3.** If you are new to networking stuff or need a refresher, then see the free courses from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-networking-for-complete-beginners/) or from [Edx](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-networking). They are decently short and easy.

**4.** Now get familiar with Pfsense, Networks, and Features.

**5.** If you prefer to have Wifi, as most will, then you need to setup VLANs. Thusly I recommend that you use [UniFi line of products by Ubiquiti](https://www.ui.com/products/#unifi). I love their products and so far have not had any major issues with them. You will need a network switch and perhaps a Wifi access point or two depending on your home. Here are some reccomendations. 

- [Ubiquiti - UniFi® Switch 8](https://www.ui.com/unifi-switching/unifi-switch-8/)

- [Ubiquiti - UniFi® AP AC PRO](https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-pro/)

**6.** Take a little more time to research and consider if you would like to have VLANs setup. This is very useful for putting junk IOT or Wifi devices that I do not trust on their own "crap network(s)". I **do not recommend** using Wifi on a secure setup unless you setup VLANs and restrict access using Pfsense firewall rules.
